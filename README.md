# VkMona / Special Relativistic Game Engine

This prototype game engine is the result of my desire of a game in which the speed of light matters. The distances involved in space travel makes light-delay an important factor, and this was the one thing I thought was missing from most space-simulators.

This project was mainly motivated by the Expeditionary Force novels written by Craig Alanson. The inspiration for some of the code is based on [LSBattle](https://github.com/sogebu/LSBattle), an implementation from the paper [Relativity For Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07063)

### Progress

- [x] Lorentz boost shader showing the effects of [Terrell rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotation)
- [x] Objects in space have a worldline
- [x] Procedure for algorithmically finding the intersection between an object's worldline and the observer's past light cone
- [x] Doppler shifting of light when travelling close to the speed of light
- [ ] Wormhole jump drive mechanics
